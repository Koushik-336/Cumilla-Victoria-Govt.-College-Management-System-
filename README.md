2. Requirements & Specifications:
The college management system is a software application that will allow the college staff to manage various aspects of college operations such as admissions, student records, faculty records, course schedules, financial management, library management, and other administrative tasks. The system will provide real-time data access and streamline operations to improve efficiency, reduce workload and increase productivity.

Based on that, we can identify the following functional requirements:

1.	User/Admin Management: The system should provide different levels of access to users such as administrators, faculty members, and students.
2.	Student Management: The system should provide functionalities to manage student information like admission, enrollment, registration, and academic progress.
3.	Faculty Management: The system should provide functionalities to manage faculty information such as hiring, promotion, and payment.
4.	Result System: The system should provide functionalities to manage the grading system such as recording grades, calculating GPAs, and generating transcripts.
5.	Financial Management: The system should provide functionalities to manage financial aspects of the college such as tuition fees, student loans, and scholarships.

Next, we can identify the non-functional requirements such as:

1.	Security: The system should be secure and protect sensitive data.
2.	Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle a large number of users and data.
3.	Performance: The system should perform well and respond quickly to user actions.
4.	Usability: The system should be easy to use and intuitive.
5.	Availability: The system should be available 24/7.

•	The system should allow students to view their grades, dept teachers, history of college and photos of their college.
•	Student should pay their payment using the system.
3.	Faculty Management:
•	The system should allow administrators to manage faculty information such as designation and their department.
4.	Grading System:
•	The system should allow faculty members to record grades and calculate GPAs.
•	The system should allow students to view their grades.
5.	Financial Management:
•	The system should allow administrators to manage financial aspects of the college such as tuition fees.
•	The system should allow students to view their financial information such as tuition fees and payment history.
6.	Security:
•	The system should be secured with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
•	Passwords should be encrypted for security purposes.
7.	Scalability and Performance:
•	The system should be able to handle a large number of users and data.
•	The system should respond quickly to user actions.
8.	Usability:
•	The system should be easy to use and intuitive.
•	User interfaces should be designed with usability in mind.
9.	Availability:
•	The system should be available 24/7.

3.	Architecture:
I used Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in my project. 
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a popular software development pattern used for developing applications that require separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability. The MVC pattern separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.

Here are some reasons why the MVC architecture is commonly used in software development projects:

1.	Separation of concerns: The MVC architecture separates the application's concerns into three distinct components. This separation of concerns makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as changes to one component won't necessarily affect the others.
2.	Code reusability: The separation of concerns in MVC allows for greater code reusability, as each component can be used independently of the others.
3.	Easy to maintain: The MVC architecture is easier to maintain because each component has a clear responsibility, making it easier to identify and fix issues when they arise.
4.	Scalability: The MVC architecture allows for greater scalability, as each component can be scaled independently of the others.
5.	Testability: The separation of concerns in MVC makes it easier to test each component independently, which improves the overall quality of the code.
6.	Encourages good coding practices: The MVC architecture encourages good coding practices, such as separating concerns, adhering to SOLID principles, and using design patterns, which ultimately results in cleaner, more maintainable code.

MVC architecture is a widely used software development pattern because it offers a number of benefits, including separation of concerns, code reusability, maintainability, scalability, testability, and good coding practices.

Here are some pros and cons of using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in software development:

Pros:
1.	Separation of concerns: MVC separates the application's concerns into three distinct components, making it easier to maintain and update the codebase.
2.	Code reusability: Because MVC separates concerns into different components, it is easier to reuse code and integrate it with other applications.
3.	Testability: Because of its modular architecture, MVC is easier to test, making it more reliable.
4.	Flexibility: MVC provides a lot of flexibility in how it is implemented, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
5.	Clear division of responsibilities: The clear separation of responsibilities between the model, view, and controller makes it easier to develop and debug code.

Cons:
1.	Complexity: The MVC architecture can be more complex than other architectures, especially for small-scale projects.
2.	Learning curve: The MVC architecture has a steeper learning curve than other architectures, which may be a challenge for new developers.
3.	Overengineering: There is a risk of overengineering when using MVC, as developers may create too many components or layers, leading to unnecessary complexity.
4.	File structure: The file structure required for an MVC application can be complex, especially for larger projects.
5.	High overhead: Implementing an MVC architecture can have a high overhead in terms of development time and resources.

Overall, while the MVC architecture has some drawbacks, its benefits in terms of separation of concerns, code reusability, testability, flexibility, and clear division of responsibilities make it a popular choice for software development projects.

4. Verification & Validation 
Here are some Verification and Validation (V&V) activities that could be performed for a college management system software project:
1.	Requirements review: Reviewing the software requirements to ensure that they are complete, accurate, and testable.

2.	Design review: Reviewing the software design to ensure that it meets the requirements and that it is structured in a way that facilitates testing and maintenance.
3.	Code review: Reviewing the source code to ensure that it is consistent with the design and that it adheres to coding standards and best practices.
4.	Unit testing: Testing individual units or modules of code to ensure that they meet the requirements and that they function correctly in isolation.
5.	Integration testing: Testing the integration of multiple units or modules to ensure that they work correctly together and that they meet the requirements.
6.	System testing: Testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the requirements and that it functions correctly in different scenarios.
7.	Acceptance testing: Testing the system in collaboration with the stakeholders to ensure that it meets their needs and that it is ready for release.
8.	Regression testing: Testing the system after changes have been made to ensure that existing functionality has not been affected.
9.	Performance testing: Testing the system to ensure that it performs adequately under expected loads and stress.
10.	Security testing: Testing the system to ensure that it is secure and that sensitive data is protected.

By performing these V&V activities, the college management system software project can ensure that the software meets the requirements, is reliable, and is ready for release to the end-users.
